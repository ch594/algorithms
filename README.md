My implementations of algorithms and data structures as I'm going through the CLRS book. Also using this to store programming problems. I'm storing in a directory corresponding to where I've found. 

I'm storing the implementation of data structure and algorithms in the /src directory. There is a makefile in each of the subdirectories. Running "make" compiles an executable that allows user testing of the algorithm by input via command line.
